## Improving surfing experience for clients  by analyzing data


## Overview:

The project in hand is with W. Avy who so far had a great expereince working with us and he has further instructed us to provide him with  more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. 

More Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
The tools we have used to provide the detailed analytical report were:


Python(Pandas, Matplolib), SQLAlchemy. 
Flask was used to provide a preview but we have not used FLask for generating this report.

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.
